# Lab Report 1, Week 2


This is a tutorial on how to ssh into your remote account. First you will:
## Install VScode

This is fairly simple; [download your preferred build](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and follow the instructions presented by the installer, configuring options as needed. Once this is complete, VS Code will start and you will be presented with the depicted screen. 

## Alternative: Atom

Atom is another text editor; it is the text editor I am personally using. The primary advantages of VS Code are that it comes with a terminal built into the interface, and has a built in markdown editor. In Atom, these features can be supplanted by using the default terminal on your computer (I am on Windows 10; I use CMD) and installing a [markdown preview package](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview).
